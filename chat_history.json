        "response": "The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi has developed an innovative method to monitor the health of ageing bridges using traffic data. The research team, led by Dr Subhamoy Sen, has created a digital model of the bridge that predicts how different traffic patterns impact various parts of the bridge over time. This helps experts identify the areas most susceptible to damage. After pinpointing these critical zones, fatigue-sensitive sensors are installed at key locations to monitor stress and vibrations. This real-time data, combined with traffic patterns from the digital model, allows experts to track how traffic affects the bridge over time and make necessary adjustments to ensure the bridge\u2019s safety and prevent damage. This method also allows for rapid assessments after events like earthquakes or floods, aiding officials in making quicker safety decisions."

        "response": "This is a news article from India Today about the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi developing a new method to monitor ageing bridges using traffic data. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **What's happening:** IIT Mandi has created an innovative method to assess the health of aging bridges.\n*   **How it works:**\n    *   They create a digital model (virtual replica) of the bridge.\n    *   This model uses traffic data to predict how different traffic patterns will affect the bridge over time.\n    *   They identify the most vulnerable areas of the bridge.\n    *   Sensors are placed in these critical areas to monitor stress and vibrations.\n    *   The real-time data from the sensors and the traffic patterns from the model help experts track the bridge's health and make necessary adjustments (like changes to traffic flow or speed).\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   More cost-effective than traditional methods because they focus on specific areas.\n    *   Allows for quick safety decisions, especially after events like earthquakes or floods.\n    *   Reduces the need for extensive and disruptive traffic management during inspections.\n*   **Key People:** The research team is led by Dr. Subhamoy Sen, Associate Professor at the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, along with his research scholar Eshwar Kuncham.\n*   **Focus:** The method focuses on predicting and preventing fatigue-induced damage and deterioration in bridges."
